# Welcome to the HAMSTER contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution will be highly appreciated and we will mention all contributors on [https://github.com/h-cel/hamster](https://github.com/h-cel/hamster). 

Before you continue, please read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which will help us to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide will provide an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a pull request, reviewing, and merging the pull request.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the code or the documentation, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/h-cel/hamster/issues). 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/h-cel/hamster/issues/new). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues]((https://github.com/h-cel/hamster/issues) to find one that interests you. 
You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Small changes in docs
If you want to make small changes (fixing a typo or a sentence, updating broken links) in any of the `.md` files, you can do this using the user interface: 
just click on the **edit** button, make your changes, commit them to a new branch and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

#### Bigger changes affecting HAMSTER
If you want to contribute bigger changes that influence of the analysis with HAMSTER, we kindly ask you to do and test these on your local machine. Therefore, fork this repository and run some tests on your local computer. 
Make the necessary changes, test the changes, and only commit if they run successfully (we will include standard tests in the future). 
Once done, you can again [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request. 
- Please add a detailed description of the changes that will help us to review your pull request. 
- Don't forget to link any issue if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your pull request, a HAMSTER team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a pull request can be merged via pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the user interface. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your pull request and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your pull request is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The HAMSTER team thanks you :sparkles:.
